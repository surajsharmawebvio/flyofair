                                    When traveling solo, it's important to have a rough plan in place, especially if
                                    it's your first time. Research your destinations in advance, and have a basic
                                    itinerary. However, don't over-plan! Leave some room for spontaneity so you can
                                    explore new opportunities and experiences that arise along the way. If you're
                                    feeling anxious about traveling solo for the first time, consider starting with
                                    a
                                    short trip, or offline destination known for being solo traveler-friendly. Many
                                    European cities, Southeast Asia, and parts of Latin America have well-trodden
                                    paths
                                    with plenty of resources for solo travelers.
